## Summary
[Mattermost](https://mattermost.com) is an open source platform for secure collaboration across the entire software development lifecycle. It's written in Golang and React and runs as a single Linux binary with MySQL or PostgreSQL.

This repo contains a Kubernetes Operator for Mattermost to simplify deploying and managing your Mattermost instance.

The Mattermost server source code is available at https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server.

## Install

See the installation instructions at https://docs.mattermost.com/install/install-kubernetes.html.

## Migrate to Mattermost Custom Resource

In version `v2.0.0` of the Mattermost Operator, several breaking changes will be introduced. Some of the more significant ones are:
- The name of the Custom Resource changed from `ClusterInstallation` to `Mattermost`.
- Support for `BlueGreen` and `Canary` deployments was dropped.
- Layout of some fields changed.

To prepare for the new release all `ClusterInstallation` Custom Resources need to be migrated to `Mattermost`.
Mattermost Operator in version `v1.12.0` provides a mechanism to make the migration easier.
To run the migration see [the automatic migration guide](./docs/migration.md).


## Restore an existing Mattermost MySQL Database
To restore an existing Mattermost MySQL Database into a new Mattermost installation using the Mattermost Operator you will need to follow these steps:

Use Case: An existing AWS RDS Database
  - First you need to dump the data using mysqldump
  - Create an EC2 instance and install MySQL
  - Restore the dump in this new database
  - Install `Percona XtraBackup`
  - Perform the backup using the `Percona XtraBackup`
    - `xtrabackup --innodb_file_per_table=1 --innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2 --innodb_flush_method=O_DIRECT --innodb_log_files_in_group=2 --log_bin=/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin --open_files_limit=65535 --innodb_buffer_pool_size=512M --innodb_log_file_size=128M --server-id=100 --backup=1 --slave-info=1 --stream=xbstream --host=127.0.0.1 --user=USER --password=PASSWORD --target-dir=~/xtrabackup_backupfiles/ | gzip - > BACKNAME.gz`
  - Upload to an AWS S3 bucket
  - Create a Mattermost Cluster, for example:
  ```
  apiVersion: mattermost.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ClusterInstallation
  metadata:
    name: example-clusterinstallation
  spec:
    ingressName: example.mattermost-example.dev
  ```
  - Create the Restore/Backup secret with the AWS credentials
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: restore-secret
  type: Opaque
  stringData:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: XXXXXXXXXXXX
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: XXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXX
    AWS_REGION: us-east-1
    S3_PROVIDER: AWS
  ```
  - Create the mattermost restore manifest to deploy
  ```
  apiVersion: mattermost.com/v1alpha1
  kind: MattermostRestoreDB
  metadata:
    name: example-mattermostrestoredb
  spec:
    initBucketURL: s3://my-sample/my-backup.gz
    mattermostClusterName: example-clusterinstallation
    mattermostDBName: mattermostdb
    mattermostDBPassword: supersecure
    mattermostDBUser: mmuser
    restoreSecret: restore-secret
  ```

If you have an machine running MySQL you just need to perform the `Percona XtraBackup` step

## Developer Flow
To test the operator locally. We recommend [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), however, you can use Minikube or Minishift as well.

### Prerequisites
To develop locally you will need the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).

First, checkout and install the operator-sdk CLI:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/operator-framework
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/operator-framework
git clone https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk
cd operator-sdk
git checkout master
make install
```

If you made changes to any structs representing Custom Resources make sure to regenerate code and manifests:
```
make generate manifests
```

If generation produced any unexpected changes, clean old binaries and rerun the generation:
```
make clean generate manifests
```

> If the manifest generation is making changes to package paths this is [a known bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/gengo/issues/147) while running the previous command outside `GOPATH` or by having the `GOPATH` flag unset. Make sure you clone the repository in the appropriate folder (see below) and that your `GOPATH` environment variable is set.

### Building mattermost-operator
To start contributing to mattermost-operator you need to clone this repo to your local workspace.

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/mattermost
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mattermost
git clone https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-operator
cd mattermost-operator
git checkout master
make build
```

### Testing locally with Kind
Developing and testing local changes to Mattermost Operator is fairly simple. For that you can deploy Kind cluster.

> **NOTE:**
> You don't need to push the mattermost-operator image to DockerHub or any other registry if testing with kind. You can load the image, built with `make build-image`, directly to the Kind cluster by running the following:
> ```bash
> kind load docker-image mattermost/mattermost-operator:test
> ```

To spin up an appropriate Kind cluster and deploy dependencies, run:
```bash
make kind-start mysql-minio-operators
```

After Kind cluster is up and running, build Mattermost Operator image, load it to Kind cluster and deploy it. For that, run:
```bash
make build-image kind-load-image deploy
```

### Accessing Mattermost Installation on Kind

After you create Mattermost installation using Mattermost Operator on Kind cluster,
port-forward the service to access it:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/[MATTERMOST_NAME] 8065:8065
```

### Running Operator locally against K8s cluster

Mattermost Operator can be run on local machine against remote a Kubernetes cluster to rapidly test changes during the development.

To run Operator locally:
- Make sure you are connected to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Install Custom Resources by running: `kubectl apply -f ./config/crd/bases`.
- Install MinIO and MySQL operators: `make mysql-minio-operators`.
- Make sure Mattermost Operator **is not** running in the cluster or scale it down to 0 replicas to avoid unexpected behaviour.
- Run Operator binary: `go run .`

Be aware that running Operator locally does not verify Kubernetes manifests, RBAC rules, leader election etc.

## Notes

### Installation Size

The `spec.Size` field was modified to be treated as a write-only field.
After adjusting values according to the size, the value of `spec.Size` is erased.

Replicas and resource requests/limits values can be overridden manually but setting new Size will override those values again regardless if set by the previous Size or adjusted manually.

## Release

To release a new version of Mattermost Operator you need to:

- Have the repository up-to-date
- Have the remote upstream configured
- Have a clean repo, not pending commits and changes

As a first step of release process generate deployment manifests:
```
make yaml
```

We have a script that changes some files, commit those changes and then tag the main branch.

To run you can issue the following command:

```bash
./scripts/release.sh --tag=<DESIRED_TAG>
````

where:

- <DESIRED_TAG> can be 1.10.1 for example
