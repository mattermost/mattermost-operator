Blubr
=====

A [logr](https://github.com/go-logr/logr) implementation using [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus).

The Name
--------

It's a small reference to the walrus theme of Logrus. It's also fun to say.


Origin
------

Blubr was originally developed for the purpose of using [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) to provide logging for the [Mattermost Operator](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-operator). In order to do so, we developed the necessary interfaces to meet the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user/logging.md#operator-sdk-logging) requirements for logging.

Todo
----

A few of the interfaces require additional work to finalize them. Todo comments call out most of these tasks.
